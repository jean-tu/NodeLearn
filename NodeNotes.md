You can write your front end & back end in the same langauge. 

* **Synchronous Tasks** - when you have to wait for a previous task to be finished before you can run the next one
* **Asynchronous Tasks** - when you can start running the next task before the previous one has finished

* **Callback** - reaching back to a section of code when 

## Modules 
* You can pass things from one JS file to another with `exports.<varName>` 
* To retrieve the text you have to have a "require" on the other end	 `var myModule = require('./myModule.js');`
* Node Package Manager = npm 	
	* One or more packages bundled together 	  
			
 
NPM = Node Package Manager
